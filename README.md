# Rock Paper Scissors Project

This is a console-based **Rock Paper Scissors** game, built as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The player competes against the computer in a series of 5 rounds. Each round, the player chooses between "rock," "paper," or "scissors" via a prompt, and the computer randomly selects one of the options. 

The game checks for valid input and applies the rules of Rock Paper Scissors to determine the winner of each round. After all rounds are completed, the overall winner is declared based on the scores.

The project helps reinforce basic JavaScript concepts like functions, loops, and conditional statements.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Make a choice when prompted by the console (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. Compete against the computer and see if you can win more rounds!

Enjoy the game!
