# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a **Rock Paper Scissors** game, built as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The player competes against the computer in a series of rounds, with the first player to reach 5 wins being declared the overall winner.

The player can click one of the buttons — "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" — to make their choice. The computer randomly selects one of the options. The game displays the result of each round, updates the score, and shows a final winner when one of the players reaches 5 wins.

This project helps reinforce concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and JavaScript functions.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click on one of the buttons ("Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors") to make your choice.
3. The game will display the results of each round, and the score will be updated.
4. The first player to score 5 points wins the game.
5. After the game ends, you can click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

Enjoy the game!
